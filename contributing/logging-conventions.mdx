description: "How we write logs that are clear, consistent, and incident-ready"

## Rules

### Write for humans first (machines second)

Logs are read most often during incidents.

**Good**

```
Failed to connect to database (host=db01, timeout=5s)
```

**Bad**

```
DB error
```

**Rule of thumb:** If someone sees the log at 3 a.m., they should immediately know what happened, where, and why.

### Always include context

Context turns noise into signal.

Include:

- IDs (`requestId`, `userId`, `orderId`, `correlationId`)
- Important parameters (never secrets)
- System state if relevant

**Good**

```
User authentication failed (userId=42, ip=192.168.1.10)
```

**Bad**

```
Authentication failed
```

### Be explicit about what failed

Avoid vague verbs like "error occurred".

**Good**

```
Failed to parse JWT token (reason=invalid_signature)
```

**Bad**

```
JWT error
```

### Use consistent structure

Consistency makes logs searchable and parseable.

**Recommended pattern**

```
<action> <result> (key=value, key=value)
```

**Example**

```
Fetched player session successfully (playerId=9c1e..., durationMs=12)
```

### Match log level to intent

Misused log levels destroy signal.

| Level | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| TRACE | Very detailed internal flow (almost never in prod) |
| DEBUG | Useful for developers, disabled in prod |
| INFO | Expected, important lifecycle events |
| WARN | Unexpected but recoverable situations |
| ERROR | Failed operation, user impact possible |
| FATAL | App cannot continue |

**Anti-pattern**

```
ERROR Starting HTTP server on port 8080
```

### Log once, at the right layer

Do not log the same failure at every level of the stack.

**Rule**

- Log where you can add the most context.
- Lower layers should throw, higher layers should log.

### Never log secrets or PII

This includes:

- Passwords
- Tokens (JWT, API keys)
- Session cookies
- Personal data (unless legally approved)

**Bad**

```
Login failed (password=hunter2)
```

**Good**

```
Login failed (userId=42)
```

### Avoid logs that describe the obvious

Code already tells part of the story.

**Bad**

```
Entering method handleRequest
Exiting method handleRequest
```

**Better**

```
Handled request successfully (method=POST, path=/login)
```

### Prefer facts over emotions

Logs are not comments.

**Bad**

```
This should never happen!!!
```

**Good**

```
Unexpected state: player already logged in (playerId=...)
```

### Log outcomes, not intentions

Say what did happen, not what you wanted to happen.

**Bad**

```
Trying to send email
```

**Good**

```
Email sent successfully (messageId=..., recipient=user@example.com)
```

### Make logs searchable

Think ahead to tools like Elasticsearch, Loki, or Datadog.

- Use stable keys: `requestId`, not `req`
- Avoid free-form blobs
- Keep messages short and structured

### Language and tone

- Use English (industry standard for mixed teams)
- Use present or past tense
- Be precise, neutral, and professional

### Example: bad vs good

**Bad**

```
Something went wrong while processing request
```

**Good**

```
Failed to process login request (userId=42, reason=invalid_credentials)
```

## Quick checklist before committing

Ask yourself:

- Can I understand this without reading the code?
- Does it include enough context?
- Is the log level correct?
- Would this help during an incident?
- Is anything sensitive included?
