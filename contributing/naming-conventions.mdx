title: "Repository and Project Naming Conventions"
description: "Guidelines for naming repositories in the Grounds organization"
---

## Goal

The goal of this convention is to define clear, concise, and consistent repository names that:

- are easily understandable for new (including external) contributors
- immediately reveal the role of a repository
- are not redundant with the existing GitHub organization (grounds)
- remain scalable in the long term (Services, Plugins, Libraries, Infra, Minestom)

## General Naming Schema

### Format

- `<type>-<name>`
- kebab-case
- lowercase
- no additional grounds- prefix, as the GitHub organization already has this name

## Repository Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `service` | Backend microservices (e.g., gRPC / REST APIs) |
| `plugin` | Minecraft plugins (Velocity, Paper, or both) |
| `minestom` | Minestom-based server logic (e.g., Lobby) |
| `library` | Reusable libraries (e.g., gRPC Contracts, SDKs) |

## Examples

### Services

- `service-player`
- `service-status`

### Plugins

- `plugin-server-discovery`
- `plugin-player`

### Minestom

- `minestom-lobby`

### Infrastructure

- `infra-dev`
- `infra-charts`

### Libraries

- `library-grpc-contracts`

## Plugin Repository Structure

For `plugin-<name>` repositories, the following structure is recommended:

```
plugin-<name>/
├── common/
├── velocity/
├── paper/
└── minestom/
```

- **common**: Shared logic (e.g., Models, Configs, Utilities)
- **velocity**: Velocity-specific implementation
- **paper**: Paper/Spigot-specific implementation
- **minestom**: Minestom-specific implementation

## Architecture Thoughts & Discussion

### Services vs. Libraries

- Services are language-independent and communicate via gRPC (protos are published).
- Libraries (e.g., Service-Clients) can be used as Gradle/Maven dependencies.
- Minestom, Plugins, and other server software should consume services, not hardcode logic.

### Minestom

- Minestom is considered standalone "Server Software" (`minestom-*`)
- Shared logic should be integrated via libraries or service-clients

## Excluded Projects

Some projects are excluded from the general naming conventions. This includes repositories that are intentionally kept generic and intended for broad reuse.

Examples of such projects include:

- [`b3`](/tools/b3/index)
- [`cockpit`](https://github.com/groundsgg/cockpit)
- [`containers`](/tools/containers/index)
- [`charts`](/tools/charts/index)

These repositories follow their own context-dependent naming schemes and are not named according to the usual `<type>-<name>` pattern, as their purpose is cross-project or cross-domain.
