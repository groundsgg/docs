# Installation

The plugins are published to GitHub Packages. To use them, you need to configure your project to access the GitHub Packages Maven repository.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the plugins, ensure you have:

- Gradle 7.0 or higher
- A GitHub account with access to the `groundsgg` organization
- A GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` permission

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Gradle Packages Access")
4. Select the `read:packages` scope
5. Generate the token and copy it immediately

<Warning>
Store your token securely. You won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Configure Gradle Properties

Add your GitHub credentials to Gradle properties. You can do this in one of two ways:

### Option A: User-level Configuration (Recommended)

Add credentials to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
github.user=your-github-username
github.token=your-personal-access-token
```

### Option B: Project-level Configuration

Add credentials to your project's `gradle.properties` file:

```properties gradle.properties
github.user=your-github-username
github.token=your-personal-access-token
```

<Tip>
User-level configuration is recommended as it allows you to use the same credentials across all projects without committing them to version control.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure Plugin Management

Add the GitHub Packages repository to your `pluginManagement` block in `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*")
            credentials {
                username = providers.gradleProperty("github.user").get()
                password = providers.gradleProperty("github.token").get()
            }
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

<Note>
The `gradlePluginPortal()` should remain in the repositories list to allow Gradle to resolve other plugins from the Gradle Plugin Portal.
</Note>

## Step 4: Apply the Plugin

Apply the appropriate plugin in your `build.gradle.kts` file based on your project type:

### Root Plugin

For root projects or shared configurations:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.root") version "0.1.1"
}
```

### Paper Plugin

For Paper server plugin projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.paper") version "0.1.1"
}
```

### Velocity Plugin

For Velocity proxy plugin projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.velocity") version "0.1.1"
}
```

## Step 5: Verify Installation

Verify the plugin is correctly installed by running:

```bash
./gradlew tasks --all
```

You should see tasks provided by the plugin in the output. For example, with the root plugin, you'll see Spotless formatting tasks.

## Multi-Module Projects

For projects with multiple modules, configure the plugin management at the root level:

```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*")
            credentials {
                username = providers.gradleProperty("github.user").get()
                password = providers.gradleProperty("github.token").get()
            }
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

rootProject.name = "my-project"
include("paper-plugin", "velocity-plugin")
```

Then apply the root plugin in the root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.root") version "0.1.1"
}
```

And apply specific plugins in each subproject's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin paper-plugin/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.paper") version "0.1.1"
}
```

```kotlin velocity-plugin/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.velocity") version "0.1.1"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Verify your GitHub token has `read:packages` permission
2. Check that `github.user` and `github.token` are correctly set in your Gradle properties
3. Ensure the token hasn't expired

### Plugin Not Found

If Gradle cannot find the plugin:

1. Verify the repository URL is correct: `https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*`
2. Check that `gradlePluginPortal()` is included in the repositories list
3. Ensure you're using the correct plugin version (check [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/groundsgg/packages?repo_name=library-gradle-plugin) for available versions)

### Version Updates

To update to a newer version, change the version number in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.root") version "0.1.1" // Update this version
}
```

Check the [GitHub repository releases](https://github.com/groundsgg/library-gradle-plugin/releases) for the latest version.
