The plugins are published to GitHub Packages. To use them, you need to configure your project to access the GitHub Packages Maven repository.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the plugins, ensure you have:

- Gradle 7.0 or higher
- A GitHub account with access to the `groundsgg` organization
- A GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` permission

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Gradle Packages Access")
4. Select the `read:packages` scope
5. Generate the token and copy it immediately

<Warning>
Store your token securely. You won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Configure Gradle Properties

Add your GitHub credentials to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
github.user=your-github-username
github.token=your-personal-access-token
```

## Step 3: Configure Plugin Management

Add the GitHub Packages repository to your `pluginManagement` block in `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*")
            credentials {
                username = providers.gradleProperty("github.user").get()
                password = providers.gradleProperty("github.token").get()
            }
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

<Note>
The `gradlePluginPortal()` should remain in the repositories list to allow Gradle to resolve other plugins from the Gradle Plugin Portal.
</Note>

## Step 4: Apply the Plugin

Apply the base conventions plugin with a version, then add the conventions that match your project type:

### Base Conventions (required)

Apply once per project (usually in the root project):

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.base-conventions") version "0.3.0"
}
```

### Kotlin Conventions

For Kotlin projects (typically shared/common modules):

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.kotlin-conventions")
}
```

### Paper Conventions

For Paper server plugin projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.paper-conventions")
}
```

### Velocity Conventions

For Velocity proxy plugin projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.velocity-conventions")
}
```

### Minestom Conventions

For Minestom server plugin projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.minestom-conventions")
}
```

### gRPC Conventions

For gRPC projects:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.grpc-conventions")
}
```

## Step 5: Verify Installation

Verify the plugin is correctly installed by running:

```bash
./gradlew tasks --all
```

You should see tasks provided by the plugin in the output. For example, with base conventions, you'll see Spotless formatting tasks.

## Overriding Paper, Velocity, or Minestom Versions

Your project can request a higher Paper, Velocity, or Minestom version by declaring it in dependencies. Lower versions are not supported.

- Current Paper version: `1.21.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`
- Current Velocity version: `3.4.0-SNAPSHOT`
- Current Minestom version: `2026.01.08-1.21.11`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Overrides the Paper version with a higher one
    compileOnly("io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.21.12-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Multi-Module Projects

For projects with multiple modules, configure the plugin management at the root level:

```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*")
            credentials {
                username = providers.gradleProperty("github.user").get()
                password = providers.gradleProperty("github.token").get()
            }
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

rootProject.name = "my-project"
include("paper-plugin", "velocity-plugin")
```

Then apply the base conventions in the root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.base-conventions") version "0.3.0"
}
```

And apply specific conventions in each subproject's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin paper-plugin/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.paper-conventions")
}
```

```kotlin velocity-plugin/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.velocity-conventions")
}
```

```kotlin grpc-module/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.grpc-conventions")
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Verify your GitHub token has `read:packages` permission
2. Check that `github.user` and `github.token` are correctly set in your Gradle properties
3. Ensure the token hasn't expired

### Plugin Not Found

If Gradle cannot find the plugin:

1. Verify the repository URL is correct: `https://maven.pkg.github.com/groundsgg/*`
2. Check that `gradlePluginPortal()` is included in the repositories list
3. Ensure you're using the correct plugin version (check [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/groundsgg/packages?repo_name=library-gradle-plugin) for available versions)

### Version Updates

To update to a newer version, change the version number only on `gg.grounds.base-conventions`:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("gg.grounds.base-conventions") version "0.3.0" // Update this version
}
```

Check the [GitHub repository releases](https://github.com/groundsgg/library-gradle-plugin/releases) for the latest version.
